# Rice University Thesis Template (LaTeX)

## Building via the command line

There are several tools for automatically compiling LaTeX projects into PDFs.
We recommend using the thesis PDF using `latexmk`,
which comes with most TexLive distributions.

### Build

    latexmk -pdf thesis_main.tex

### Clean

    latexmk -c thesis_main.tex

## LaTeX Editors
