    Is there enough energy to move the entire current human population off-planet?
}{\textit{Adam}}

There are a bunch of science fiction movies where,
because of pollution, overpopulation, or nuclear war, humanity abandons Earth.
But lifting people into space is hard.
Barring a massive reduction in the population,
is launching the whole human race into space physically possible?
(See \cref{fig:the-plan}.)
Let's not even worry about where we're headed---%
we'll assume we don't have to find a new home, but we can't stay here.
